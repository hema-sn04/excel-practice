This repo contains my Excel practice files: PivotTables, Charts, and small datasets

Just uploading all my Excel practice files here.
From day 1 basics to my mini sales project, everything’s in this repo.

What’s in here

Data entry, formatting, formulas, charts, PivotTables

50-row Sales table project with totals, sorting, and charts

Different versions of files as I improve

Why?

So I can track my progress and show off my Excel skills for internships
